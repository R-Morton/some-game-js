# Some Game JS

## Description
I have already had this game idea sometime ago and started writing it in Python. Now I am re writing this code to work as a react app so that it can be more than just a terminal app.

The aim is to develop a medieval role playing adventure game with turnbased combat. This is mainly being developed to improve my skills using javascript and react.js. It is also a personal project of mine that I will enjoy creating.

## Planned Features (For now ...)

* Turn based melee fighting
* Health and stamina management
* Character leveling system
* Inventory Management (Weapons, Armor, Gold etc)
* Merchants
